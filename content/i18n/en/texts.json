  "text-8-1": "INTRODUCTION",
  "text-8-2": "Generally, we associate exercising, eating a balanced diet, and visiting the primary care doctor at least once a year, as the main health care measures.",
  "text-8-3": "However, there is a vital aspect of our balance that we do not give the importance it deserves, and that is mental health.",
  "text-8-4": "According to the World Health Organization (WHO) (2004), a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being goes beyond the mere absence of afflictions or diseases.",
  "text-8-5": "For this reason, the care of health should not be reduced to physical aspects, as it involves a more comprehensive view of well-being.",
  "text-8-6": "From this more complete and integral vision, a challenge arises, which involves understanding that the different areas of health care are not limited to a specific institution, group, or individual; integral health care requires a share of responsibility from all parties.",
  "text-8-7": "The concept of self-care comprises all those daily practices and decisions developed by a person, group, or family to take care of their health and have a better quality of life (Correa, 2016).",
  "text-8-8": "Therefore, establishing moments of self-care is essential, as it influences overall health and provides multiple benefits such as:",
  "text-8-9": "reduce stress,",
  "text-8-10": "improve mental health",
  "text-8-11": "managing emotions better,",
  "text-8-12": "avoid burnout syndrome (synonym of professional burnout, its literal translation in Spanish is 'being burned out'), etc.",
  "text-8-13": "In the present manual, the different types of self-care will be addressed and how they can be practiced comprehensively to ensure the physical and mental health of people who work directly with populations that are victims of gender-based violence and/or are experiencing a situation of vulnerability.",
  "text-9-0": "Self-care Manual",
  "text-9-1": "What is Self-care?",
  "text-9-2": "It is an approach to health in which the individual is responsible for carrying out individual and/or collective actions that can strengthen or restore the state of overall well-being, as well as prevent diseases.",
  "text-9-3": "In this sense, self-care requires the development of practices that, according to the interests and learned skills, as well as the usual customs of the culture, promote survival and favor taking responsibility in solving what affects one's health.",
  "text-9-4": "The personal practices that self-care entails, although they vary among individuals, primarily aim at the preservation of health.",
  "text-9-5": "Therefore, indeed, having an adequate diet and engaging in healthy physical activities are part of possible self-care practices, but it is also important to have good social relationships, learn to recognize and value one's own emotions, rest when necessary, among other personal care activities.",
  "text-10-0": "Self-care Manual",
  "text-10-1": "Principles of self-care",
  "text-10-2": "Among the principles of self-care, some of the following elements should be considered when addressing it (Uribe, 1999; Correa, 2016):",
  "text-10-3": "It is an act of life that allows people to become active subjects in caring for their health, and it is a voluntary process of the person for themselves.",
  "text-10-4": "It is an individual responsibility and a daily commitment that is based on a formal and informal health system with social support.",
  "text-10-5": "When engaging in self-care practices, whether for protective or preventive purposes, people do so with the certainty that they will improve their level of health.",
  "text-10-6": "To achieve self-care, a certain degree of personal development is required, which is mediated by a permanent strengthening of self-concept, self-control, self-esteem, self-acceptance, and resilience.",
  "text-11-0": "Self-care Manual",
  "text-11-1": "Importance and benefits of self-care",
  "text-11-2": "The incorporation of self-care routines is key to improving quality of life and preventing diseases, both physical and mental (anxiety, depression, among others), as well as for recovering in the case of experiencing them.",
  "text-11-3": "In fact, it has been identified that by incorporating these practices, there is greater adherence to therapeutic treatments by patients with chronic diseases (Bastidas, 2007).",
  "text-11-4": "This favors the restoration of health and empowers the person, giving them more resources and control over the situation affecting their well-being.",
  "text-11-5": "Learning to take care of oneself is a way to improve the relationship with oneself, it involves knowing oneself better and knowing what practices and interests contribute to one's own health.",
  "text-11-6": "Self-care invites the person to think about what really excites and inspires them, helping to better understand the physical, social, cognitive, and emotional needs that support them.",
  "text-11-7": "These efforts and care send a message about the value we place on health and self-care, allowing us to visualize the importance of the person; in general lines, it can be said that it improves self-esteem.",
  "text-11-8": "Having greater self-awareness and valuing one's own needs promotes decision-making and the establishment of boundaries both for oneself and for others.",
  "text-11-9": "In essence, it consists of recognizing one's own capabilities and respecting one's well-being.",
  "text-11-10": "One evidence is the establishment of boundaries that separate work life from personal life. There are those who decide not to respond to messages and calls outside of working hours, while others, either due to their position or profession, cannot make that decision and opt for other measures. The important thing is to respect their needs.",
  "text-11-11": "The incorporation of self-care behaviors enhances productivity: if there is a review of needs and a consequent establishment of boundaries, the most important ones are prioritized.",
  "text-11-12": "The person learns to say no to less important matters and focuses on goals that foster growth, maintaining a healthy state that allows for optimal performance.",
  "text-11-13": "These decisions have an impact on others, as being focused allows a person to perform better in areas such as work or family, but mainly the impact occurs on the person who incorporates these behaviors into their life.",
  "text-12-0": "Self-care Manual",
  "text-12-1": "In others, the impact is evident not only in the increase in productivity,",
  "text-12-2": "but also in the improvement of interpersonal relationships,",
  "text-12-3": "it involves working on aspects such as emotional management and the ability to resolve conflicts.",
  "text-12-4": "Self-care is not about engaging in isolated and meaningless care activities.",
  "text-12-5": "the goal is to take responsibility for one's own health and, in many cases, to begin a process of personal work,",

  "sectioneli5-2-0": "A 'Self-Care Manual' is like a small guide that teaches you how to take care of yourself. Imagine it as a little booklet with tips on how to be happy and healthy. It can teach you things like eating well, resting enough, and making sure you feel good every day. It's a way to tell your body and mind 'I take care of you.'",
  "sectioneli5-6-0": "Here is a list of topics from a book about self-care. Self-care means taking care of oneself. It talks about taking care of the body, emotions, thoughts, how you get along with others, and your spirit. It also provides exercises to practice and a list of books for further reading. It's like a guide to taking care of yourself every day.",
  "sectioneli5-8-0": "When we think about taking care of our health, we usually think about exercising, eating well, and visiting the doctor. But it is also very important to take care of our mind. Complete health means being well in body and mind. It is not just about not being sick. Taking care of health is something we all must do together.",
  "sectioneli5-8-1": "Self-care means doing things every day to feel good and take care of our health. It is important because it helps reduce stress, improves how we feel, and helps us manage our emotions. If we take good care of ourselves, we avoid feeling 'burned out' or very tired from working too much. The manual teaches different ways to do this to be healthy inside and out, especially for those who help people in difficult situations.",
  "sectioneli5-9-0": "Self-care is when we take care of ourselves to stay healthy and avoid getting sick. This means doing good things like eating well and resting. The image shows a person watering themselves, as if they were a plant, to grow strong and happy.",
  "sectioneli5-9-1": "Self-care means doing things that help keep us healthy and happy, like a superhero taking care of themselves. This includes eating well, exercising, and resting. Each person has different ways of caring for themselves based on what they like and what they've learned. The idea is that we are all responsible for taking care of our own wellbeing.",
  "sectioneli5-9-2": "Self-care means taking good care of yourself to be healthy and happy. To do this, you can eat well and exercise, but it's also very important to have good friends, understand how you feel, and rest when you need to. This way your body and mind feel better.",
  "sectioneli5-10-0": "Self-care is when you take care of yourself. Imagine taking care of a plant: you need to provide water, light, and attention. For people, taking care of oneself means doing things like eating well and resting. It's something you decide to do for yourself each day. It's also important to have friends and family who support you. Taking care of yourself strengthens important things like feeling good about yourself, being resilient, and loving yourself as you are.",
  "sectioneli5-11-0": "Self-care is like a superpower to be healthier and happier. If you take good care of yourself by doing things like resting, eating well, and doing what you enjoy, you can prevent getting sick or feeling sad. Moreover, if you're already sick, taking care of yourself helps you get better faster. It's like having more tools to feel better and stronger every day!",
  "sectioneli5-11-1": "Taking care of oneself is like learning more about what you like and what makes you happy. It helps you understand what your body and mind need to be well. It's like sending a message to yourself that says 'I am important.' This helps you feel good about yourself and gives you more confidence.",
  "sectioneli5-11-2": "Understanding oneself better and knowing what you need helps in making decisions and setting boundaries. For example, some people choose not to respond to work messages in their free time to separate work from their personal life. The important thing is to know what you need and take care of your well-being. This helps you feel better and be happier.",
  "sectioneli5-11-3": "When you take care of yourself and set boundaries on what you do, you can better concentrate on what is most important. This means saying 'no' to things that do not help you grow. This way, you feel better and work better on things that are important to you and to others.",
  "sectioneli5-12-0": "Self-care is like taking care of yourself. It not only helps you accomplish more things, but it also helps you get along better with others. This is because it teaches you to manage your emotions and solve problems. Imagine giving yourself a hug to feel better and happier.",
  "sectioneli5-12-1": "Self-care is more than doing random things to take care of oneself. It is about taking our health seriously and working on ourselves. This can take time, but it is important to feel better.",
  "sectioneli5-13-0": "Sometimes people think that taking care of oneself is selfish, but in reality, it is important in order to be able to care for others as well. They think that self-care is something that never changes, but in reality, it can adapt to what you need each day. To take care means knowing what you do to stay healthy and acting according to that, like eating well and properly.",
  "sectioneli5-13-1": "Sometimes people think that taking care of oneself is being selfish, but that's not true. Taking care means being responsible and ensuring you are healthy. If you don't take care of yourself, you can't help others. It's like putting air in your own bicycle tires to ride well and help friends with their bicycles if they need it.",
  "sectioneli5-13-2": "Sometimes we do things out of inertia, like eating every day without thinking about whether it is healthy. Self-care is about becoming aware of these actions and doing them better, like choosing healthier food. It's not just about knowing, but about doing something to take good care of yourself.",
  "sectioneli5-13-3": "Some people think that taking care of oneself means doing the same thing every day. But it is not so. Taking care of yourself should change according to what you need at that moment, so you can do it in different ways and at different times. It is important to listen to your body and adapt care to your needs!",
  "sectioneli5-14-0": "Sometimes, we believe that taking care of ourselves means always doing what is best for us. But in reality, self-care is about looking after our health and well-being by doing things we enjoy and that align with our likes and needs. It is not an obligation, but something we do because it benefits us and makes us feel good.",
  "sectioneli5-14-1": "Sometimes we think that taking care of ourselves requires a lot of money or things, but that is not true. There are free activities we can do to take care of ourselves, the important thing is to dedicate time to them.",
  "sectioneli5-14-2": "Some people think that taking care of oneself only means resting. That is not true. Resting is important, but taking care of oneself also includes doing things like exercising, learning something new, or playing. All of these help to be healthy and feel good.",
  "sectioneli5-14-3": "Taking care of yourself is like taking care of a plant: you need to pay attention and realize what you need to be well. You develop good habits little by little, like watering a plant every day, to ensure that you grow strong and healthy.",
  "sectioneli5-15-0": "Self-care is like taking care of yourself, like when you look at yourself in the mirror to know how you feel. There are different ways to do it. One way is individual self-care. This is when you do things to take care of your health because you understand what you need. For example, resting when you are tired or eating well. The image shows a person looking at themselves in the mirror, which represents being self-aware.",
  "sectioneli5-16-0": "Collective self-care is when a group of people, such as friends or a family, help each other to be healthy and happy. This is done by working together on activities that improve the place where they live and support each other, as seen in the image where two friends hug and say 'I Support You, Friend'. It is a way to care for everyone, not just oneself.",
  "sectioneli5-16-1": "Collective self-care is when we all help make the place we live better. For example, we can pick up trash together, play sports to stay healthy, plant trees to have more nature, or talk with friends about books or movies that we like. All these things help us all be happier and healthier.",
  "sectioneli5-16-2": "Taking care of oneself is important, but it is also important when everyone in a group, such as friends or in the community, takes care of health together.
