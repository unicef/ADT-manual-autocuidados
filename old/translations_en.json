        "text-8-4": "According to the World Health Organization (WHO) (2004), a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being goes beyond the absence of ailments or diseases.",
        "text-8-5": "For this reason, health care should not be reduced to physical aspects, as it involves a more comprehensive view of well-being.",
        "text-8-6": "Based on this more complete and integral vision, a challenge arises that involves being clear that the different areas of health care are not limited to a specific institution, group, or individual. Comprehensive health requires a share of responsibility from all parties.",
        "text-8-7": "The concept of self-care consists of all those daily practices and decisions that a person, group, or family develops to take care of their health and have a better quality of life (Correa, 2016).",

        "text-9-3": "In this sense, self-care requires the development of practices that, according to the interests and learned skills, as well as the usual customs of the culture, promote survival and encourage taking responsibility for solving what affects one's health.",
        "text-9-4": "Personal practices that constitute self-care, while varying among individuals, primarily aim at the preservation of health.",
        "text-9-5": "Therefore, indeed having a proper diet and doing healthy physical activities are part of possible self-care practices, but it is also important to have good social relationships, learn to recognize and value one's own emotions, rest when necessary, among other personal care activities.",

        "text-10-4": "It is an individual responsibility and a daily commitment that is based on a formal and informal health system with social support.",
        "text-10-5": "When performing self-care practices, either for protective or preventive purposes, people develop them with the certainty that they will improve their level of health.",
        "text-10-6": "For self-care to occur, a certain degree of personal development is required, which is mediated by a permanent strengthening of self-concept, self-control, self-esteem, self-acceptance, and resilience.",

        "text-11-10": "One evidence is the establishment of boundaries that separate work life from personal life. Some people decide not to respond to messages and calls outside of work hours, while others, due to their position or profession, cannot make that decision and opt for other measures. The important thing is to respect their needs.",
        "text-11-11": "The incorporation of self-care behaviors enhances productivity: if there is a review of needs and a consequent establishment of limits, the most important ones are prioritized.",
        "text-11-12": "The person learns to say no to less important matters and focuses on the goals that help them grow, maintaining a healthy state that allows them to perform optimally.",
